Issues/Errors Detected
-----------------------

1) The "lift_lexical_references" pass should not lead in an invalid model, but extract metadata instead.
Type: Crash (Invalid Model)
Description: The pass removes the references arbitrarily, without checking if they are used in the model (e.g., on the initializer)
Pass: lift_lexical_references
