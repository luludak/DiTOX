Issues/Errors Detected
-----------------------

1) The "lift_lexical_references" pass should not lead in an invalid model, but extract metadata instead.
Type: Crash (Invalid Model)
Description: The pass removes the references arbitrarily, without checking if they are used in the model (e.g., on the initializer)
Pass(es): lift_lexical_references
Issue URL: https://github.com/onnx/optimizer/issues/156
Severity: Low (secondary pass)

2) The "split" passes result in invalid models.
Type: Crash (Invalid Model)
Description: The passes result into invalid models. I would expect that each part would be a valid net, but this is not the case. I invoked them separately to determine which part plays a role to it, and both passes result in invalid nets.
Pass(es): split_init, split_predict
Severity: Low (secondary pass)
Issue URL: https://github.com/onnx/optimizer/issues/157

3) The "split_predict" pass crashes with ShapeInferenceError.
Type: Crash (Invalid Model)
Description: The "split_predict" pass gives [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Node (Resize_140) Op (Resize) [ShapeInferenceError]
Pass(es): split_predict
Severity: Low (secondary pass)
Issue URL: https://github.com/onnx/optimizer/issues/157 (comment)

4) Pass "eliminate_shape_gather" results in a dimension size error.
Type: Crash (Optimizer)
Description: While running "eliminate_shape_gather" pass for model R-CNN R-50-FPN it gives a dimension size error.
Pass(es): eliminate_shape_gather
Severity: Medium (primary pass, optimizer crash)
Issue URL: https://github.com/onnx/optimizer/issues/158
